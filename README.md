This project contains common Pentaho Connections API code.  Currently this
code is used within the Pentaho BI Suite and Pentaho Metadata.

The Pentaho Connections API defines a common set of interfaces for dealing
with connections and result sets.  Currently implementations of this API are
within the Pentaho BI Suite (svn:pentaho) but will eventually be pulled into a
separate commons project.
